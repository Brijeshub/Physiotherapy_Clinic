      <p>The foot pain is one common condition when you get to feel pain right under the heel or behind it. There are various conditions resulting in such pain, including Achilles or flexor tendonitis, plantar fasciitis, Bursitis, Stress fractures, inflamed tendons, and more. It is vital to have a medical evaluation immediately to help you determine the right cause of the heel or foot pain to start a proper treatment regimen. Foot or heel pain makes it really difficult to walk or even participate in daily activities. Most of these conditions will improve with non-surgical treatments, but it will take some time to recover completely.</p>
