          <p>The hand and wrist form a group of complex, delicately balanced joints which are considered the most active portion of the upper extremity. Optimal overall function is important to so many activities of daily living. A hand and wrist examination done in a structured manner will help to facilitate the most appropriate working diagnosis for treatment. Diagnosing hand and wrist conditions is often difficult and for this reason, bilateral comparison can be useful[1]</p>
